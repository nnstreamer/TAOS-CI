# Introduction

TAOS-CI is an automated project coordinator to achieve "**Review less, merge faster**" with a tool-based review system. It accelerates a software development based on the GitHub WebHook API. We aim to prevent a regression, find bugs, and reduce a nonproductive review process due to incorrect PRs in https://GitHub.com. Actually, submitting incorrect PRs is a PITA in case of continuous integration. Basically, PRs causing regressions will not be automatically merged. As a result, it drastically reduces the existing burdens of reviewers.
- Minimize a nonproductive review process
- Provide a test automation (both build and run)
- Prevent a performance regression
- Find bugs at a proper time before merging buggy codes
- Generate a doxygen-based developer manual
- Support modulable facilities with plug-in interface
- Integrate the existing opensource tools easily
- Verify an integrity of a package by supporting a platform build
- Support multiple operating systems as follows:
  - Ubuntu: https://www.ubuntu.com/
  - Tizen: https://source.tizen.org/
  - Yocto: https://www.yoctoproject.org/
  - Android: https://source.android.org
  - TBD & TBI

## Goals	
The proposed system supports a light-weight code review automation approach to support a desktop computer based servers that have out-of-date CPUs and low memory capacity. Also, if you want to enable your project specific CI facilities, it will be easily customizable for your GitHub repository because it just requires APACHE, PHP, and BASH packages. Especially, we are mainly concentrating on the following three goals among a number of action items.

* Automating tests (both build and run)
* Preventing Performance regression
* Finding potential bugs at a proper time

## Maintenance
Please refer [Here](./ci/doc/maintenance.md).
