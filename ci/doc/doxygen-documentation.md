Doxygen: Generate documentation from source code
=================================================

Doxygen is the de facto regular tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, however, it additionally supports different well-known programming languages akin to C, objective-C, C#, Hypertext Preprocessor, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL and Tcl.

# Install doxygen & graphviz
* If you want to run [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to
  produce documentation from your code comments, then in addition do the following:
  * Install [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) using the
    instructions on its web site. For reference, The LLVM web site is using Doxygen 1.7.6.1
    however the 1.8 series added support for Markdown formatting. We would like
    to use Markdown in our comments ASAP, so use the latest version of Doxygen.
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install doxygen
    ```
  * Install [graphviz](http://graphviz.org/) using instructions on their
    site. The current version no longer modifies your path, so you should
    manually modify your path so that it includes "dot".
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install graphviz
    ```

# How to generate documentation from source code
* If you want to automatically generate documentation from source code in Linux by using doxygen, proceed as follows:

    ```
    # for src app
    $ cd ./gst
    $ doxygen ../Doxyfile.prj

    # launch with the browser to view the results
    $ chromium-browser ./html/index.html
    ```

# How to comment
### Comments for Files

Each file needs to begin with the `@file` command stating the name of the file. This should be followed by a brief description of the file using the `@brief` command. If necessary, you can follow this with a more detailed description. Next you should put your name and andrew id, along with your partners name and andrew id, using the `@author` tag. This needs to be followed with a bugs section with a list of known bugs using the `@bug` command. If there are no known bugs, explicitly state that using the `@bug` command.

### Comments for Functions and Data Structures

Before each function, data structure, and macro you should put a comment block giving at least a brief description using the `@brief` command. A brief description will suffice for your data structures but for your macros and functions you will need to use a few more commands. After your description, you should use the `@param` command to describe all of the parameters to your function. These descriptions should be followed by a description of the return value using the `@return` command. Note: When we say "each" function, that is not a strong statement. You can leave out simple helper functions, like a max() macro, so you do not waste time.


### Interesting doxygen Tags & Syntax
```bash
@note: 'lhc' stands for "Large Hadron Collider" in the function/method below
@todo: Implement a delta-time loop class to replace this
@tofix:asap: Accumulator doesn't have enough precision; change type to double, and deal with the cascading effects throughout the code
@asap: Everyone, update your IDEs to newest version to avoid bug-X
@issue: I'm missing an import but I don't know which...I get 'Exception (...)'
@done: I've sent a copy of the missing lib to Bob, and explained him how to use it. Issue removed
@bug: Indicates something where a situation on the input or flow of the program leads to outright breaking of the program
```

# How to generate the index page in HTML
If the Doxygen tag @mainpage is placed in a comment block, the block is used to
customize the index page (in HTML) or the first chapter (in $@mbox{@LaTeX}$).
The title argument is optional and replaces the default title that doxygen
normally generates. If you do not want any title you can specify notitle
as the argument of @mainpage.

Below is a simple example of a mainpage you can create yourself.

```bash
/**
 *  @mainpage   AutoDrive
 *  @section intro Introduction
 *  - Introduction      :   Application repository for autonomous solution
 *  @section   Program  Program Name
 *  - Program Name      :   AutoDrive
 *  - Program Details   :   This includes a number of internal modules which
 *  are sensing & perception, planning & control, global map generation, logging & HMI.
 *  This repository consists of TAOS-based applications as following:
 *  1) creates perception information form sensor inputs,
 *  2) handles map & routing information,
 *  3) controls the vehicle,
 *  4) and provides developers with debugging tools.
 *  @section  INOUTPUT    Input/output data
 *  - INPUT             :   None
 *  - OUTPUT            :   None
 *  @section  CREATEINFO    Code information
 *  - Initial date      :   2017/06/14
 *  - Version           :   0.1

# How to generate script code
Refer to https://github.com/Anvil/bash-doxygen
Doxygen does not support bash script files by default.
Edit below lines in a Doxyfile.ci to generate *.sh files.

```bash
$ vi ./Doxyfile.ci
# Set your shell script file names pattern as Doxygen inputs
FILE_PATTERNS = *.sh *.php *.taos
ITAOST_FILTER = "sed -e 's|##|//!|'"
FILTER_SOURCE_FILES = YES
# Edit the Doxyfile to map shell files to C parser
EXTENSION_MAPPING = sh=C
```
