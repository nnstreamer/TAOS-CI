# @brief    Check a doxygen grammar if a doxygen can normally generates source code
#
# Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++
# sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C,
# C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL,
# Tcl, and to some extent D.

# @author   Geunsik Lim <geunsik.lim@samsung.com>
# @note
#  Note that module developer has to execute a self evaluaton if the plug-in module includes incorrect grammar(s).
